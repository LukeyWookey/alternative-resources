## Alternative Recursive Resources

A Minecraft **Java-Edition** resource pack which changes the folders textures from the [Recursive Resources](https://modrinth.com/mod/recursiveresources) mod, made by enjarai, to look like oak planks.  
This should work for all versions of the mod (Ignore the _"This pack was made for an older/newer version of Minecraft"_ warning)

_Credits to Enjarai for the original folder texture, the one in this resource pack is highly inspired from it_

You can find the download for this pack on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/alternative-resources), or download the raw files here.
